Table: Enrollments

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| course_id     | int     |
| grade         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(student_id, course_id) is the primary key of this table.
grade is never NULL.


Write a SQL query to find the highest grade with its corresponding course for each student. In case of a tie, you should find the course with the smallest course_id.

Return the result table ordered by student_id in ascending order.



INITIALLY I WROTE

--> select student_id, course_id, MAX(grade) from Enrollments group by student_id order by student_id;
(BUT THIS JUST GIVES STUDENT_ID AND GRADE CORRECT BUT NOT COURSEID AS IT IS AGGREGATING MAX ONLY ON GRADE AND COURSEID IS ANY FIRST OCCURING)

--> select student_id, min(course_id) as course_id, grade from Enrollments where (student_id, grade) in (select student_id, max(grade) from Enrollments group by student_id) group by student_id order by student_id;
