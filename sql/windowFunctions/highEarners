A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.


--> with mycte as(
  select d.name as dname, e.name as ename, e.salary, ROW_NUMBER() over(partition by d.name order by e.salary desc) as rn from Employee e inner join Department d on e.departmentId = d.id
)
select dname as Department, ename as Employee, salary as Salary from mycte where mycte.rn < 4;
-----------INITIALLY I WROTE THIS BUT HERE WE NEED NOT HAVE TWO SALARIES AS SAME, THAT MEANS IT NEEDED TOP 3 UNIQUE SALARIES, SO WE USED DENSE_RANK AS IT GIVES SAME RANK TO SAME VALUE


--> with mycte as(
  select d.name as dname, e.name as ename, e.salary, DENSE_RANK() over(partition by d.name order by e.salary desc) as rn from Employee e inner join Department d on e.departmentId = d.id
)
select dname as Department, ename as Employee, salary as Salary from mycte where mycte.rn < 4;
