177. Nth Highest Salary
P7(USING DISTINCT TO AVOID MULTIPLE RECORDS WITH SAME RANK USING DENSE_RANK)

Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.


Find the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, return null.

--> CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      with mycte as(
          select id, salary, DENSE_RANK() over(order by salary desc) as rn from Employee
      )
      select mycte.salary from mycte where mycte.rn = N
  );
END
INITIALLY I WROTE THIS BUT THERE CAN BE MULTIPLE RECORDS WITH RANK N SO WE NEED TO USE DISTINCT WHILE SELECTING SALARY


--> CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      with mycte as(
          select id, salary, DENSE_RANK() over(order by salary desc) as rn from Employee
      )
      select distinct mycte.salary from mycte where mycte.rn = N
  );
END
