614. Second Degree Follower

P9(USING DISTINCT INSIDE COUNT TO COUNT DIFFERENT FIELD VALUE OCCURENCES IN JOIN)

Table: Follow

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| followee    | varchar |
| follower    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(followee, follower) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the user follower follows the user followee on a social network.
There will not be a user following themself.


A second-degree follower is a user who:

follows at least one user, and
is followed by at least one user.
Write an SQL query to report the second-degree users and the number of their followers.

Return the result table ordered by follower in alphabetical order.

--> select a.follower, count(*) as num from Follow a inner join Follow b on a.follower = b.followee group by a.follower order by a.follower;
INITIALLY I WROTE COUNT(*) BUT THIS DOESN'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN FOLLOWER AND FOLLOWEE SO WE NEED TO EXPLICITLY COUNT DISTINCT FOLLOWER IN SECOND TABLE

--> select a.follower, count(distinct b.follower) as num from Follow a inner join Follow b on a.follower = b.followee group by a.follower order by a.follower;
