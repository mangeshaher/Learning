In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.


Find the managers with at least five direct reports


INITIALLY I WROTE

--> select e1.name from Employee e1 inner join Employee e2 on e1.id = e2.managerId group by e1.name having count(e1.name) >=5;
(BUT THIS DOESN'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TWO NAMES AND CAN GIVE OTHER SAME NAME EVEN IF IT DOESN'T SATISFY HAVING CONDITION)

--> select e1.name from Employee e1 inner join Employee e2 on e1.id = e2.managerId group by e1.name, e1.id having count(e1.name) >=5;
